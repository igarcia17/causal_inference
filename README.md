Illustration of different causal inference scenarios and what happens when it is model in a wrong or a correct way. Data can be biased, the estimates can have different variance, trands may change if we condition or not for other variables, etc. 

This project is divided in three different parts:

- Common cause cases: confounders, mediators and effects.
- Common effect cases: colliders, ascendants, descendants and bias.
- Complex cases: Berkson's paradox, Simpson's paradox and backdoor criteria.

These examples are based in simplifications of real life problems, but the quantitative interactions between variables is not based in real studies. We recommend to take a look at the vignette, as it gives a context to what we have done in the code.

The repository is build to make possible the compilation of a R package in the future.

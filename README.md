Illustration of different causal inference scenarios, in which estimates can be biased, present an increased standard error and how these patterns change with changes in the size or variance of the effects. This project is divided in three different parts:
- Common cause
- Common effect
- Complex cases

The fir
These examples are based in simplifications of real life problems, but the quantitative interactions between variables shouldn't be considered

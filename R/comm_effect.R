# We are going to try two specific scenarios, one where we adjust for Z and
# another where we don't. The purpose of these two scenarios is to check whether
# adjusting for a collider will induce a bias in our estimates and how exactly
# this bias will change these estimates. 




#_________________________________SITUATION 1___________________________________

# Lets first generate our DAG according to a collider structure where X and Y
# are independent:
comm.effect.DAG <- dagitty("dag {
X -> Z
Y -> Z
}")

coordinates(comm.effect.DAG) <- list(x = c(X = 1, Y = 3, Z = 2),

drawdag(comm.effect.DAG)


# Let us generate the data according to the DAG:

set.seed(11)

N <- 500 # Our sample size throughout the whole code will be 500
b_xz <- 3 # The value of the relation between X and Z is 3
b_yz <- 2 # The value of the relation between Y and Z is 2
sd_z <- 1 # The standard deviation for Z will be 5

# We will try not to repeat this information description as we already know what
# each variable represents.

X <- runif(N, 1, 10)
Y <- runif(N, 1.5, 12)
Z <- b_xz * X + b_yz * Y + rnorm(N, 0, sd = sd_z)


# Let's take a look at our data distribution, for that we will use a 
# function that plots our variables with a regression line:
PLOT.REG <- function(reg_line, plot.var = '') {
  Regres.line <- lm(reg_line)

par(op)

# As we can see, there is, apparently, a positive correlation between Z and X and also
# Z and Y. On the other hand, there is no visible correlation between X and Y 
# (as should). We can check it by calculating the estimates and significance of
# each pair. For that we will create a function that accepts the following 
# arguments: variables to check, dependent variable (to get the estimate and
# p value), and the title of the variables; the last two ones should be text
# input in order to make it work.

#Let's check our variables:
SUM.4VAR(X ~ Z, "Z", "X and Z", Y ~ Z, "Z", "Y and Z", X ~ Y, "Y", "X and Y", X ~ Y + Z, 
         "Y", "X and Y (when Z)")


# We can see a strong correlation between Z and X. There is also a positive
# relation between Z and Y, but none between X and Y. But the two independent 
# variables (X and Y) when we adjust by Z raise a correlation that wasn't 
# supposed to be there.

# When controling a collider, you can induce a bias in the estimate of the
# parent variables when there is, actually, none.




#_______________________REALISTIC EXAMPLE SITUATION 1___________________________


# We can exemplify this with a more realistic dataset: 
# Here we have a set of variables: cigarettes smoked in a day, COVID19 virus
# load and % of lung capacity. Both cigarette consumption and virus load should
# affect the lung capacity, but there should not be a relation between the 
# number of cigarettes consumed daily and the COV19 virus load.

#Let's take a look at the DAG:

DAG.Lung <- dagitty("dag {
cigarettes_day -> lung_capacity
vir_load_COV19 -> lung_capacity
}")

drawdag(DAG.Lung)


b_cd <- (-0.7) # Relation between cigarettes and lung capacity

lung_capacity <- 100 + b_cd * cigarettes_day + b_vlc * vir_load_COV19 + 
  rnorm(N, 0, sd = 0.01) # % of lung capacity


#Checking the data: 
data.frame(cigarettes_day, vir_load_COV19, lung_capacity)


# Here we have the plots showing the distribution of the variables cigarettes_day
# and vir_load_COV19, where apparently there is no correlation.
op <- par(mfrow= c(2, 1))

# A plot for comparison, cigarettes and lung capacity, a negative correlation:

par(op)



#Let's see the relations between our variables.
SUM.4VAR(cigarettes_day ~ lung_capacity, "lung_capacity", "cigarettes and lung capacity",

# No correlation between nÂº of cigarettes smoked a day and the viral load of

#___________________________MORE COMPLEX EXAMPLE________________________________

# Let's take a look at a bit more complicated example: imagine we are studying 
# the performance of a professional runner. We have a few variables to take into 
# consideration, but we will focus on the following ones: leg length,
# metabolism (which affects weight, meaning it also affects performance), heart
# disease (measured through the values of high-sensitivity cardiac troponin 
# (hs-cTn)), cholesterol (as a measure of overall health); this last variable 
# does not affect directly the performance of the runner (speed), but it might 
# through its health. 

# Let's take a look at the DAG:

DAG.Runner <- dagitty("dag {
cholesterol -> heart
metabolism -> heart
metabolism -> speed
leg_lenght -> speed
}")

coordinates(DAG.Runner) <- list(x = c(cholesterol = 1, heart = 3,

                                              leg_lenght = 1),

                                             leg_lenght = 1))
drawdag(DAG.Runner)


# To represent the effect of conditioning on a collider in this case we will
# be using data for every variable, but we will consider as if we could not 
# measure the metabolism in order to control the counfounder. 


b_ll_s <- 1.2

cholesterol <- runif(N, 125, 200) #mg/dL
speed <- leg_lenght * b_ll_s + metabolism * b_m_s + rnorm(N, mean = 0, 
                                                          sd = 5) #mph
heart <- cholesterol * b_ch_h + metabolism * b_m_h + rnorm(N, mean = 0,

#Checking the data:
data.frame(leg_lenght, metabolism, cholesterol, speed, heart)

PLOT.REG(leg_lenght ~ heart, "LEG_LEN ~ HEART")

#Let's, one more time, check the relations:
SUM.4VAR(leg_lenght ~ metabolism, "metabolism", "leg_len and metabolism", leg_lenght ~ cholesterol,
         "cholesterol", "leg_len and cholesterol", leg_lenght ~ heart, "heart", "leg_len and heart", 
         leg_lenght ~ heart + speed, "heart", "leg_len and heart (when speed)")

# There is no correlation between leg lenght and metabolism, leg lenght and 
# cholesterol and leg lenght and heart disease; but when we adjust for the 
# collider speed, we open a path between leg lenght and heart disease. We 
# do find  a correlation between heart when there is no correlation between 
# how long your legs are and cardiac disease.

#Let's look at our data and see whether this correlation we find when adjusting
# by our collider (speed) is actually present:
op <- par(mfrow= c(2, 1))
PLOT.REG(leg_lenght ~ heart, "LEG ~ HEART")

# The following plot shows the correlation that actually exists between
# the variables cholesterol and heart, as opposed to the previous ones.

# As we can see, there is, apparently a positive correlation between Z2 and X2;

# The positive correlation we find between X2 and Y2 switches to
# a negative correlation when we adjust for Z2

# As we can see, in this particular case, conditioning on Z changes the sign 
# of the estimate for the Y2 variable, as in Simpson's paradox




#____________________________PRACTICAL EXAMPLE SITUATION 2______________________

# We find no correlation between X4 and Y4, but when we condition on the 
# collider (Z) or its descendant (W4) we find a significantly negative 
# correlation between the two variables. 
# In this case adjusting by Z4 and W4 (its descendant) resulted in a correlation

#________________________PRACTICAL EXAMPLE DESCENDANT___________________________

#Practical example: we want to see how does diabetes affect heart disease
